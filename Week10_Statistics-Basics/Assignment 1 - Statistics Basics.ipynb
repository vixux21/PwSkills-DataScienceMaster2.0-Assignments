        "* **Analysis:** This is where you start to play with the data to uncover patterns and trends. Statistical methods help you find meaning in the data.\n",

        "   - Misinterpreting ordinal data as interval data (e.g., calculating the mean of satisfaction ratings) can lead to incorrect conclusions, as the differences between ratings are not necessarily uniform.\n",
        "   - Using ratio-level analysis for nominal or ordinal data can result in meaningless or misleading results.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Choice of Visualization**:\n",
        "   - Nominal data might be best represented by bar charts or pie charts.\n",
        "   - Ordinal data might use bar charts or histograms to show order.\n",
        "   - Interval and ratio data can use line graphs, scatter plots, or histograms to represent the data accurately.\n",

However, this average may not accurately reflect the true sentiment because the difference between ratings (e.g., between 2 and 3) is not necessarily the same as between other ratings (e.g., between 4 and 5). Therefore, it would be more appropriate to report the median or mode and use non-parametric tests to analyze the differences between groups.\n",

        "**Common Measures**:\n",
        "- **Central Tendency**: Mean, median, mode.\n",

        "- **Distribution**: Frequency distributions, histograms.\n",

        "  - Conduct a hypothesis test (e.g., t-test) to compare the blood pressure of patients taking the new drug versus a placebo.\n",
        "  - Calculate a confidence interval to estimate the average reduction in blood pressure for the entire population.\n",

        "In statistics, measures of central tendency and variability are used to summarize and describe datasets. Here’s a look at some common measures of each:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Measures of Central Tendency\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Mean**:\n",
        "   - **Definition**: The arithmetic average of a dataset, calculated by summing all values and dividing by the number of values.\n",
        "   - **Use**: Provides a central value around which the data tends to cluster. It is useful for understanding the general level of the dataset.\n",
        "   - **Example**: If the exam scores of a class are 70, 75, 80, 85, and 90, the mean score is (70 + 75 + 80 + 85 + 90) / 5 = 80.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Median**:\n",
        "   - **Definition**: The middle value of a dataset when it is ordered from smallest to largest. If there is an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n",
        "   - **Use**: Provides a measure of central tendency that is less sensitive to outliers and skewed data. It is useful for understanding the middle point of a dataset.\n",
        "   - **Example**: For the dataset 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, the median is 80. For the dataset 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, the median is (80 + 85) / 2 = 82.5.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Mode**:\n",
        "   - **Definition**: The value that appears most frequently in a dataset.\n",
        "   - **Use**: Indicates the most common value in the dataset. It is useful for categorical data or when identifying the most frequent value is important.\n",
        "   - **Example**: In the dataset 70, 75, 75, 80, 85, the mode is 75, as it appears most frequently.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Measures of Variability\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Range**:\n",
        "   - **Definition**: The difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.\n",
        "   - **Use**: Provides a simple measure of how spread out the values are. It gives a quick sense of the extent of variability.\n",
        "   - **Example**: For the dataset 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, the range is 90 - 70 = 20.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Variance**:\n",
        "   - **Definition**: The average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean of the dataset. It measures the spread of the data points.\n",
        "   - **Use**: Quantifies the degree of dispersion in the dataset. A higher variance indicates more spread.\n",
        "   - **Example**: If the mean of a dataset is 80 and the squared differences from the mean are calculated, variance is the average of these squared differences.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Standard Deviation**:\n",
        "   - **Definition**: The square root of the variance. It provides a measure of dispersion in the same units as the data.\n",
        "   - **Use**: Offers a more interpretable measure of spread than variance because it is in the same units as the data. It helps understand how much data deviates from the mean.\n",
        "   - **Example**: If the variance of a dataset is 25, the standard deviation is √25 = 5.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Interquartile Range (IQR)**:\n",
        "   - **Definition**: The range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3). It measures the spread of the middle 50% of the data.\n",
        "   - **Use**: Provides a measure of variability that is resistant to outliers. It focuses on the central portion of the data.\n",
        "   - **Example**: For the dataset with Q1 = 75 and Q3 = 85, the IQR is 85 - 75 = 10.\n",
