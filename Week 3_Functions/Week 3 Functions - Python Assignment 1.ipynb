        "Let's go through your questions one by one:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q1. How do you comment code in Python? What are the different types of comments?\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, comments are used to explain code and make it more readable. There are two types of comments:\n",
        "1. **Single-line comments:** Use the hash (`#`) symbol. Anything following the `#` on that line is considered a comment.\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    # This is a single-line comment\n",
        "    print(\"Hello, World!\")  # This is an inline comment\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Multi-line comments:** Use triple quotes (`'''` or `\"\"\"`). These can span multiple lines.\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    \"\"\"\n",
        "    This is a multi-line comment.\n",
        "    It can span multiple lines.\n",
        "    \"\"\"\n",
        "    print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q2. What are variables in Python? How do you declare and assign values to variables?\n",
        "\n",
        "Variables are used to store data that can be used and manipulated throughout a program. In Python, you declare and assign values to variables by using the assignment operator (`=`).\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "x = 10  # Declare a variable 'x' and assign the value 10 to it\n",
        "name = \"Alice\"  # Declare a variable 'name' and assign the string \"Alice\" to it\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q3. How do you convert one data type to another in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "You can convert data types in Python using built-in functions:\n",
        "- `int()`: Converts to integer\n",
        "- `float()`: Converts to float\n",
        "- `str()`: Converts to string\n",
        "- `bool()`: Converts to boolean\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "x = 5  # integer\n",
        "y = float(x)  # convert to float, y becomes 5.0\n",
        "z = str(x)  # convert to string, z becomes \"5\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q4. How do you write and execute a Python script from the command line?\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Write a Python script:** Create a file with a `.py` extension, e.g., `script.py`.\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    # script.py\n",
        "    print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Execute the script from the command line:**\n",
        "    ```bash\n",
        "    python script.py\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q5. Given a list `my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, write the code to slice the list and obtain the sub-list `[2, 3]`.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
        "sub_list = my_list[1:3]  # Slices the list from index 1 to 2 (3 is not included)\n",

        "### Q6. What is a complex number in mathematics, and how is it represented in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "A complex number in mathematics is a number that has both a real part and an imaginary part. It is represented as \\( a + bi \\) where \\( a \\) is the real part and \\( b \\) is the imaginary part.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, complex numbers are represented as follows:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "z = 3 + 4j  # 3 is the real part, and 4j is the imaginary part\n",
        "print(z.real)  # Output: 3.0\n",

        "```python\n",
        "price = 9.99\n",
        "# The data type of 'price' is float\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q9. Create a variable named `name` and assign your full name to it as a string. How would you print the value of this variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "name = \"John Doe\"  # Replace with your full name\n",
        "print(name)  # Output: John Doe\n",

        "s = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
